<h1>What is an Embedded System?</h1>
<h2>An embedded system is a computer system that combines the uses of a microprocessor and memory (basically a small computer) to perform a specific function within a larger system. Often, because embedded systems are designed for a specific function, they have real time computing restraints, including memory and speed constraints. [1] </h2>
<br>
<h2>Examples of standalone embedded systems: </h2>
<br>
<h3>1.) Digital Cameras</h3>
<h3>2.) MP3 Players</h3>
<h3>3.) Calculators</h3>

<h2>Examples of bigger systems that have integrated embedded systems:</h2>
<br>
<h3>1.) GPS Systems</h3>
<h3>2.) Automotive Systems</h3>
<h3>3.) Drones</h3>

<h2>Each of these larger systems have smaller systems within it that are designed to complete specific tasks. For example, a car may have up to 100 embedded systems within its greater system.
