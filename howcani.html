<h1>Why are embedded systems useful?</h1>
<h2>Now that you know what an embedded system is, you may be wondering how we can use them to improve our daily lives. In our world today, embedded systems are being developed to tackle the world's most difficult problems. </h2>
<br>
<h3>1.) SpaceX’s automated landing system. SpaceX has tackled the challenge of making the world's first reusable rocket. Starship’s flight computers (the rocket that they are creating) are programmed using C and C++ to automate the launch, flight and landing of the rocket.</h3><br>

<h3>2.) Tesla autopilot: the pinnacle of self driving cars. Using machine learning, Tesla has been able to equip its cars with full self driving technology (currently in beta). Using eight cameras, 12 ultrasonic sensors, and radars, they are able to find the current position on a road and make the needed adjustments. </h3><br>

<h3>3.) NASA’s perseverance rover. Currently driving on the crust of mars, this rover had to be designed to withstand the extreme colds, winds, and be able to take samples for people on earth to research. The embedded systems on board needed to be radiation hardened, which further reduced the computing power of the computers. They needed to be programmed with every fault in mind, as it would be difficult to adjust the firmware of the robot once it was on mars. </h3><br>

<h2>Throughout history, embedded systems have driven forward some of the greatest events of mankind. Only time will tell what amazing things will continue to come out of this field of study.</h2><br>
